# Processess

Documentation of the agile processes and practices we follow/do and why.

## Purpose

The purpose of writing this down is *not* to enshrine it in immutable law. 

It's positive purpose is two fold:

- To aid new members of the team on getting up to speed on how and why things work they way they do
- To ensure everyone knows the why behind how we work and the team has a clear shared understanding of how everyone is expected to work.
