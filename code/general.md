# General code style guide

## Indentation, line endings, trailing newlines

We have guidelines for these things so that we keep them consistent. The guidelines are defined in the [.editorconfig](https://github.com/livestax/liveshack/blob/master/.editorconfig)
file in the Liveshack repo. Over time, it might make sense to copy it into our
other projects too.
