# Agile

Agile methodology comes in a variety of flavours and level of prescriptive-ness. At Livestax we follow agile with a little a, not with a big A.

What does this mean? It means that we don't cargo cult and the *only* part of the process that absolutely has to happen is that the team has a [retrospective](retrospectives.md). That's it.

Everything is a loose gathering of lightweight processes that can be changed via the [retrospective](retrospectives.md).

- [Standup](standup.md)
- [Backlog prioritisation](backlog.md)
- [Retrospectives](retrospectives.md)
- [Show and tell](show_and_tell.md)
