# Standup

Standup currently happens every day and includes all team members.

## Format

The current designated time for standup is at 9.45am. If everyone is present in the office then everyone stands up and follows the format of:

- What did you do yesterday?
- What are you doing today?
- Are there any blockers?

If any member of the team is not present in the office then standup is done in the #general slack channel following the same 3 question format.

## Why

The idea behind a standup is that the team can share what they're working on and provide the opportunity to ask for help or to offer help before picking up something new to work on. It's a reminder that you are not developing in isolation so some of the work you're doing may affect your team mates.

Standup is about shared ownership of the work and a self organising/empowered team.

## Flexibility

The format of the standup, the frequency of standup and the time of standup are all within the team's power to change as and when it's appropriate. Suggesting any substantial changes to standup is probably best brought up in retrospective so it can be discussed as a team.
