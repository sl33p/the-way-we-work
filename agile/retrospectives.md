# Retrospectives

Currently a retrospective happens once every two weeks. It is a designated time for the team to come together, in a safe space, to reflect on how things are going, is the process working and what, if anything, may need to change.

A retrospective is the singular part of agile that absolutely must happen. It is the team's most effective tool for making changes to the process.

## Format

There are [many](http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=Retrospective_Plans) different ways to run a retrospective. The @mnowster method is to ask the team rather than inflict a retrospective style on them. It can be helpful to mix it up a bit so bring a suggestion to an alternative style if you would like but ultimately it's the team decision.

It is worth taking it in turns to run a retrospective as it's a valuable reminder that in agile it's about the team and not individual agendas. Yes, it does mean that each retrospective someone misses out on contributing but it also has the benefit that it ensures that everyone gets heard.

At the start of the retrospective it's worth saying out loud the following:

- A recap of any actions from the previous retrospective and if they got done. If any remain undone, they can be added to the end of this retrospective to be discussed why they haven't been done and understand what the blocker might be.
- Communicate to the team what the format of the retrospective is going to be and how long the team has to write down on sticky notes for each focus point. Eg. 2 minutes for things that went well, 2 minutes for things that didn't go well.
- Remind everyone that retrospective is a safe space and retros are not for blaming people/shaming any individual.
- Remind everyone that any stickies they wish to not be captured in the [retrospective write up](https://github.com/livestax/retrospectives) must write clearly in the top corner the word, PRIVATE.

Next, ensure everyone has adequate number of sticky notes and pens. Have a clear timer and vocalise when the timer starts and the amount of time left.

Once all notes have been written, start with the person to the left of whoever is running the retrospective and go in a clockwise fashion around the team for them to read out their not going so well(sad face) stickies. Once all the sad stickies have been read out, then go around the team again for them to read out their happy stickies.

After all stickies have been read out, then encourage discussion amongst the team to help suggest any actions that could be done to mitigate/improve any of the issues the sad stickies have raised. The person running the retro then captures each action and writes it on a sticky and places it visible to the team. It is also worth capturing any actions to ensure that happy things continue as well.

Thank the team for taking part in the retrospective.

Whoever ran the retrospective is then responsible for gathering up the stickies and writing them up in the [retrospective repo](https://github.com/livestax/retrospectives). Capure any of the actions as trello cards.

## Why

The fundamental part of following any kind of agile process is to allow the team to be agile, to give them the power and responsibility to change any processes that aren't working for them and inhibiting delivery.

Any part of the process can be changed as it may become clear from the retrospective that a process is causing issues. It is entirely normal, natural for a team's work flow to ebb and change, so some process may get removed and then put back again in a month's time as the nature of the work and size of the team shifts.

It requires the whole team to take ownership of the way they work and to be empowered by those around them to work in a way that is effective, positive and collaborative.
