# How we Trello

- New tickets should be created in the "Icebox" column. 
  + Tickets can be as brief or as verbose as time allows. 
  + You might be asked to revisit the ticket to add more details later
- The Icebox column should be pruned regularly, and should never contain more than a handful of tickets. 
  + Pruning is the responsibility of the Product Owner and Lead Developer.
  + When moving tickets, make sure they are comprehensible (see notes below)
- Tickets can be moved to a "Someday" column if not a strict priority. 
  + This will help to ensure we don't lose track of work to be carried out later
  + Another reason is to ensure Icebox stays empty
  + Someday should be revisited and pruned/deleted/archived too.
- Other columns should describe distinct pieces of work (epics, some would call them). 
  + These columns will vary depending on the current priorities.
- Ready / Doing / Done will become labels instead of columns
