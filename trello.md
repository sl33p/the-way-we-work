# How we Trello

- New tickets should be created in the "Inbox" column. 
  + Tickets can be as brief or as verbose as time allows. 
  + You might be asked to revisit the ticket to add more details later
- The Inbox column should be pruned regularly, and should never contain more than a handful of tickets. 
  + Pruning is the responsibility of the Product Owner and Lead Developer.
  + When moving tickets, make sure they are comprehensible (see notes below)
- Tickets can be moved to the "Icebox" column if not a strict priority. 
  + This will help to ensure we don't lose track of work to be carried out later
  + The Inbox column should be at Zero as often as possible so we can see the space cat.
  + Icebox should be revisited and pruned/deleted/archived too.
- Other columns should describe distinct pieces of work (epics, some would call them). 
  + These columns will vary depending on the current priorities.
  + They will also relate to high-level tickets in the Roadmap board
- The most important tickets are at the top of the column

- During the backlog sessions cards will be moved from the epics to the Ready (prioritised) column. 
  + We will keep track of the origin of the icons using the following system:
    + Our Example epic column is about the onboarding process so we'll call it "**ðŸŽŸ Onboarding Process**"
    + The emoji (picked at random or with great care) will follow the tickets to the new board
    + So our ticket in **Ready (prioritised)** is called "ðŸŽŸ Improve registration email copy" showing it's ancestral home.
- Add your face to a card (press the spacebar, magic!) only when you're working on it.
- Move the card you're working on to the Doing column. 

## Example Card

----

**Title:**
For example:
ðŸŽŸ Improve registration email copy

**Members:**

This is where youy add your face

**Labels:**
Let's keep current labels and iterate:
Ops / Backend / Spike etc.

**Description:**
 In every ticket, the description should have at least one Job Story (like a User Story). You can read about the idea [here](https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27#.fb8wrphl9) and [here](https://blog.intercom.io/using-job-stories-design-features-ui-ux/), but the format is:.

When _____ , I want to _____ , so I can _____ .

For example: When a customer signs up, I want the notification to be clear, so they understand how to register and login.

**Checklist:**

If your ticket's large break it up into several tickets or make a checklist to show progress

**Due Date:**

If applicable. Mostly for things like "renew secure certificate" or whatnot.

**Attachments:**

It's good practice to document visual changes with screenshots. Gifs showing how things work are great. You can also add a nice graphic to the card to make it nicer to look at.

**Comments:**

Use this to document the state you left the ticket in when moving it from one state to another.
Comments might get lost (if tickets are moved between boards) so don't use for critical information, description is better suited for this.
